Hide your WP Admin URL using a secret term and secure your website against hackers!!

== Description ==

Hide your WP Admin URL by rename deafult wordpress admin URL (i.e /wp-admin or /wp-login.php)

If you run a WordPress website, you should absolutely use "protect-wp-admin" to secure it against hackers.

Protect WP-Admin fixes a glaring security hole in the WordPress community: the well-known problem of the admin panel URL.
Everyone knows where the admin panel, and this includes hackers as well.

Protect WP-Admin solve this problem by allowing administrator to customize their admin panel URL and blocking the default links.

Administrator will be able to change default login page url "sitename.com/wp-admin" to something like "sitename.com/custom-string", so after that guest user will be redirect to the homepage.

The plugin also comes with some access filters, allowing Administrator to restrict guest and registered users access to wp-admin, just in case you want some of your editors to log in the classic way.

= NOTE :Back up your database before beginning the activate plugin. =

It is extremely important to back up your database before beginning the activate plugin. If, for some reason, you find it necessary to restore your database from these backups. Plugin will not work for IIS SERVER.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* 1.) Nothing happen after enable and add the new wordpress admin url? 

   Don't worry, Just update the site permalink ("Settings" >> "Permalinks") and re-check,Now this time it will be work fine

* 2.) Not able to login into admin after enable plugin? 

 May be issue can come when you not give proper writable permission on htaccess file OR you have not update permalink settings to SEO friendly url from admin. You can access login page url with default wp-admin slug after disable my plugin, you can disable plugin through FTP by rename protect-wp-admin folder to any other one. 

* 3.) Am i not able to login after installation

Basicaly issues can come only in case when you will use default permalink settings. 
If your permalink will be update to any other option except default then it will be work fine. Anyway Dont' worry, manualy you can add code into your site .htaccess file.

<code>
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteRule ^newadmin/?$ /wp-login.php [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^newadmin/register/?$ /wp-login.php?action=register [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^newadmin/lostpassword/?$ /wp-login.php?action=lostpassword [QSA,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
</code>

Don not forgot to update the "newadmin" slug with your new admin slug (that you were added during update the plugin settings) :-)
